# Siteswap Suggestion Service

https://7131.github.io/suggest/

This service suggests valid siteswaps by complimenting the numbers for the input pattern.
The generated siteswaps can also be demonstrated with a juggling simulator.

There are two versions of the siteswap suggestion service: standard and simplified. In both cases, only vanilla siteswaps are covered.

  <dt>Simplified version</dt>
    <dd>This service is suitable for word searches because it enumerates valid siteswaps regardless of the number of balls.</dd>
